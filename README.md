## Project Planning:

  When starting this project, the best thing that I could have done was pick up a pen and piece paper. The very first thing that I did was draw out a wireframe for the app. Next, I started planning the game logic on paper as well. This part of the project took me the longest to figure out, but I never would have if not for breaking everything down into the smallest problems possible. Once I figured out game logic that I could wrap my head around, I started coding. It made the most sense for me to start out with basic HTML, so that I could visualize what my game engine was doing. Then, I started coding the game logic and setting up user authentication. My last challenge was connecting and saving data from the games being played to the Game API that was provided. One thing that helped me accomplish all of these goals was to make extremely explicit to-do lists. This made it less overwhelming to accomplish what I needed to.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- AJAX
- JQuery
- Provided Game Api

## Unsolved Problems
- Though my app is functional, it seems to be sending data twice whenever the PATCH method is used. This does not impact the statistics of the game, but I would like to fix that first.
- Since I was more concerned about the game and api working, I did not include as much UI focus and styling as I would have liked. In fact, it is pretty bare bones.
- I would like to go back and make this elegant and alot more user friendly.
